        //10, Jack Queen, King, and Ace. Within each set of 4 there are 4 suits: Clubs, Spades,
        //Hearts, and Diamonds. Create a Card class (with appropriate constructor, setter,
        //and getter methods) and then create a method to create a stack of 52 cards. To test
        //your deck, pop each card and print its contents.
        
        //Following this, write code that will prompt the user for two numbers: one for the number of
        //players (x) (max 4 players), two for the number of cards each player will receive (y).
        //Create x amount of stacks and push y amount of cards in each that are popped from your
        //deck of 52 cards. There should be no repeated cards and the deal should not happen if
        //more than 52 cards need to be dealt.
